## Shopify technical challenge submission

## My attempt
Unfortunately, due to technical issues, I had only a few hours to complete the challenge. I knew that I had to attempt this challenge using some sort of recursive approach. The idea of making a backtrack approach came from a class discussion involving a similar problem, so I knew exactly where to start. Once I had an idea of what the recursive function would look like, the rest came easily. To ensure my code worked properly, I used many test cases, including the most difficult Sudoku puzzles I could find online. This ensured correctness. 

Something to note is the code works assuming the inputted puzzle is a valid Sudoku puzzle. There were instances of the program giving a solution with an invalid puzzle. To solve this I had included a check to see if the inputted puzzle is valid. 

For example: This input is not a valid Sudoku puzzle, there cannot be two 5s within the same section and column.
```
[
  [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [5, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
  [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]
```

However, the program would output the following: 
```
[
  [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2],
  [5, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8],
  [1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7],
  [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3],
  [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
  [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
  [9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4],
  [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
  [3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9]
]
```

# Shopify Intern Assessment Production Engineering

## Description

Write a Go program that solves a given Sudoku puzzle. The program should take a 9x9 grid as input, where empty cells are represented by zeros (0), and output the solved Sudoku grid.

A Sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 sub-grids. The goal is to fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, each column, and each sub-grid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

Your program should implement an efficient algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle and print the solved grid to the console.

### Example: Input:
```
[
  [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
  [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
  [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
  [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]
```

### Program Output:
```
[
  [5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2],
  [6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8],
  [1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7],
  [8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3],
  [4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1],
  [7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6],
  [9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4],
  [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5],
  [3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9]
]
```

## Instructions:
1. Write a function called SolveSudoku that takes a 9x9 grid as input and returns the solved Sudoku grid.
2. Implement an efficient algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. You can use any approach or technique you prefer.
3. Confirm the validity of your code against the tests found in this repo.
4. Ensure that your code is well-documented and easy to understand.

## Constraints:
- The input grid will be a 9x9 two-dimensional array of integers.
- The input grid will have exactly one solution.
- The input grid may contain zeros (0) to represent empty cells.

## Validation: 
To validate the correctness of the solution, you can compare the output of the program with the expected output for a set of test cases containing unsolved Sudoku puzzles.
